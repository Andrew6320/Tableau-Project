Overview
This project is a KPI (Key Performance Indicator) dashboard designed for a call centre to monitor its operational performance metrics. The dashboard is developed in Tableau, a data visualisation tool that allows users to create interactive dashboards for business intelligence.
Key Features
The dashboard consists of several important elements which provide insight into various metrics:
1.	Call Volume During the Week:
o	A bar chart that shows the call volume for each day of the week.
o	It includes an average call volume line (marked in red) to help assess daily performance against the weekly average.
2.	Inbound Calls Today:
o	A large numeric display showing the total number of inbound calls received today (27 calls).
o	Another number displays the average time (3.896 minutes) it took to handle calls on this day.
3.	Overall Resolution Rate:
o	A percentage (70.47%) indicating how many calls were successfully resolved.
4.	Satisfaction Rating for the Current Month:
o	A bar chart illustrating customer satisfaction ratings for the current month, broken into five categories.
5.	Speed of Answer by Agent:
o	A heatmap-style visualization that shows how quickly different agents respond to inbound calls, with times ranging from 61.00 to 75.50 minutes.
6.	Resolution Rates by Agent:
o	A heatmap displaying individual agent performance in resolving calls. Resolution rates range from 59.18% to 78.74%.
7.	Resolved Calls by Agent:
